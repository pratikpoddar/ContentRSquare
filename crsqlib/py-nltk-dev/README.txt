==About==
	http://code.google.com/p/py-nltk-dev/

	This code is a research/academic project conducted at Kaunas University of Technology (Lithuania) in 2013-05 
	by two Informatics faculty MSc students: Aiste Ivonyte & Tomas Uktveris.

	Project analyses & applies natural language processing(NLP) algorithms 
	to texts extracted from certain year Wikipedia archived news articles.


	The created text analyzer does the following (for a given article):
	 # Extracts named entities (people) - the named entity recognition (NER) problem [ner.py] 
		  (uses default Python NLTK ne_chunker + extra logic to detect sex/city/country & remove false positives)
	 # Creates a summary from article text [summarize.py, ph_reduction.py]
	   Two methods used:
			a) Sentences with most frequent words - Summary I 
			b) Phrase reduction method - Summary II
	 # Classifies the article into 5 most frequent (top) categories from all analyzed Wikipedia articles [training.py, training_binary.py]
	   Uses three  NLTK library built-in classifiers - Bayes, MaxEnt (regression) and DecisionTree.<br>Two approaches are used for classifier training:
			a) Multiclass - classifier is trained to detect 1 class from multiple (7 classes in total)
			b) Binary - trains 3x6 binary classifiers to detect if article represents a given category
	 # Finds people actions [action.py]
		 Custom token & sentence analysis - reuses NER data to find & assign references.
	 # Resolves references/anaphoras* (named entity normalization - NEN) [references.py]
		 Custom token & sentence analysis - reuses NER data to find required verbs.
	 # Finds people interactions* [interactions.py] 
		 Custom token & sentence analysis - reuses NER & reference data for finding multiple people in sentence and their actions.

	Female/male names dictionary used from NLTK project: https://code.google.com/p/nltk/<br>
	English words dictionary used from: http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/wordlists/english/
  World cities database used from: http://www.maxmind.com/en/worldcities

==Requirements==
	 * Python 2.7 (http://www.python.org/download/releases/)
	 * Python NTLK library (http://nltk.org/) + installed all available corporas (>>> import nltk; nltk.download())

==Directory structure==
	  . - (root directory) contains all source code for the analyzer
	  ./archives - contains EN generic word, people names & country dictionaries, SQL city names DB files & scripts
	  ./db - contains extracted Wikipedia articles by month
	  ./FtpDownloader - Java utility to download articles DB from FTP site
	  ./other - misc & example scripts

==Usage==

	Running the analyzer 
	------
	 # Run article parser & data generation utility to generate the required data files for the next step:
		>> python data.py
	 
	 # Run multiclass trainer to generate three types of classifier files:

	  >> python training.py -b 
	  #>> python training.py -m
	  >> python training.py -d

	 # Run binary trainer to generate other classifier files: 

	  >> python training_binary.py -b
	  #>> python training_binary.py -m
	  >> python training_binary.py -d 

	 # Run the main analyzer script to analyze a given article:

	  >> python main.py -f db/klementavicius-rimvydas/2011-12-03-1.txt

	Running other tests
	------
		Some analyzer functionality can be tested separately by running the test_xxxx.py files.
