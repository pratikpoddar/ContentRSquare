The boss of a crime gang identified as the Popular Anticommunist (alternativelyAnti-terrorist) Revolutionary Army (PARA) has surrendered to authorities in Colombia. Jose Lopez Monteroalso called "Caracho"handed himself in yesterday.
More than 280 other members of the group also gave themselves up to police yesterday and on Thursday. Why the group members gave themselves up en masse is currently uncertain. Caracho recently told Colombian media he had "tired of war". All of the group members surrendered in Villavicencioa city located south-east of the capital Bogotá.
Judges have yet to decide upon the legal status of the gang members. The ring members will remain in Villavicencio until they do. The Office of the Attorney General of Colombia has clarified that it did not negotiate with the group members at the time of their surrender. This is understood to be one of the largest mass suspect surrenders in the country for a number of years.
Caracho is accused of conspiracywhile PARA's members are also accused of a variety of crimesincluding murder and illegal drug trade. Prosecutor Nestor Armando Novoa has stated that Caracho may also face further criminal charges due to his leadership in PARA. It is anticipated the members of the gang will say where their weapons are cached.
According to Associated Pressthe political stance of the Popular Anticommunist Revolutionary Army is uncertain. Caracho had been the leader of PARA since the death of Pedro Guerreroalso called "Cuchillo" ("Knife")who was killed in December of last year by falling in a river while trying to escape from police.
