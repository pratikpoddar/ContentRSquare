The Large Hadron Collider&mdash;the world's largest science experiment&mdash;shattered records Tuesday by successfully colliding particle beams at a combined energy of 7 teraelectronvolts (TeV). This marks a milestone in the collider's progress, and will usher in the beginning of up to two years of intensive investigations.In just a few hours, detectors along the LHC's 17-mile tube recorded 500,000 collision events. Two beams of protons were sent in opposite directions, each with an energy of 3.5 TeV, guided by thousands of large electromagnets.Guido Tonelli, a spokesman for one of the detectors, said &quot;Major discoveries will happen only when we are able to collect billions of events and identify among them the very rare events that could present a new state of matter or new particles.&quot;The LHC will eventually shut down for about a year to prepare for 14-TeV collisions. Scientists will ultimately sift through information on billions of collision events, in hope that the results will lead to a &quot;new era in science&quot;.
