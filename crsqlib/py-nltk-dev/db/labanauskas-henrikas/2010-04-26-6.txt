A 6.5 magnitude earthquake has struck off the southeastcoast of Taiwan earlier today, the US Geological Survey reports.The quake's depth was at ten kilometres (6.2 miles), which is considered relatively shallow. The epicentre was 269 kilometres (167 miles) east of T'ai-tung, Taiwan. It struck at 10:59:50 local time, or 02:59:50 UTC.The Taiwanese Central Weather Bureau said no tsunami warning was issued over the temblor; the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there is no threat of a Pacific-wide tsunami. According to the Associated Press, some buildings in the capital Taipei swayed for about twenty seconds, although there were no any immediate reports of damage, injuries, or deaths.Earthquakes occur frequently in Taiwan as the area lies on a seismically active area, although they generally do not cause much damage because they are small.
