Officials have reported that Maoist rebels in India killed at least 70 soldiers in Chhattisgarh, a central state in the country.The ambush was made on security convoys in a dense jungle in the district of Dantewada, a remote area. According to police, about 300 Maoists set off explosives and started shooting at them.&quot;Seventy-five [people] have been killed, and seven injured,&quot; commented Gopal Pillai, the Indian home secretary.This is the deadliest incident security forces have seen since they recently initiated an offensive against the Maoists; the operation has spread out across several states and includes 50,000 federal paramilitary troops, as well as thousands of policemen.The violence is still ongoing, according to police official Ashok Dwivedi. &quot;Fighting is still carrying on in the area, and we're having great difficulty getting news from there,&quot; he said.It is the biggest loss of life security forces have suffered since launching the recent offensive against the rebels.India's Home Minister P. Chidambaram remarked that the convoys had apparently &quot;walked&quot; into a trap set by the Maoists. &quot;Something has gone very wrong. They seem to have walked into a trap set by the [Maoists]. Casualties are quite high,&quot; he said.
