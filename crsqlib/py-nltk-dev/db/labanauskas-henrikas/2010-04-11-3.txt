The USGS has reported a 6.3 magnitude earthquake in Spain. It had a depth of 616.7 kilometers. The epicenter was located 25 kilometers northeast from Granada, 106 kilometers northwest of M&aacute;laga and 341 kilometers south of Madrid. It occurred on Monday at 00:08:10 local time (22:08:10 UTC).People posted via Twitter that the earthquake was felt in C&aacute;diz, M&aacute;laga, and Murcia.CNN reports there are no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or damages. &quot;An earthquake with that depth means little damage is likely,&quot; seismologist Susan Potter told CNN. She also stated that &quot;when an earthquake is deeper, the seismic energy is absorbed by the Earth, so there will be less damage expected in the epicenter area.&quot;Meanwhile, almost a month ago, on March 1, the Spanish Geologist Luis Eug&eacute;nio Suarez, said that the Granada area could suffer an earthquake within the short term, and with an intensity similar to that of the February 27 Cauquenes, Chile earthquake. Su&aacute;rez commented that &quot;Spain is not like Chile,&quot; because the latter is located on a high seismic frequency area, but also noted that &quot;once every hundred years, a destructive earthquake is produced in the peninsula.&quot;The last earthquake in Spain was in Arenas del Rey, in Granada, 126 years ago, and reached a magnitude of 6.6, leaving between 750 to 900 dead, thousands injured and material destruction.
