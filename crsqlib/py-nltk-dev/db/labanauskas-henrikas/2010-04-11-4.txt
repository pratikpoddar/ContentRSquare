A Muslim woman has been killed by her religious apparel during a freak go-cart accident in Port Stephens, Australia. Mariam Dadoun, a 26-year-old mother, was out with her two children and husband enjoying their vacation time. While visiting Port Stephens Go-Karts, the vehicle had twisted her flowing hijab in the wheel's axle.Peter Fox of Port Stephens Local Area Command said, &quot;the scarf was pulled across her throat [...] from one side of the body to the other side&quot;.Medical professionals on the scene succeeded in reviving Dadoun. However, she shortly died of severe neck and throat injuries after being airlifted in a Westpac rescue helicopter to the nearby John Hunter Hospital.The track has since been closed pending further investigation and a lack of proper licensing. The go-cart used in the accident has similarly been taken away for forensic examination by police authorities.The spokesman of the New South Wales division of WorkCover, an organization tasked with ensuring the safety of amusement devices, commented that, &quot;[Go-carts are] classified as amusement devices that have to be registered for safety purposes&quot;. One go-cart on the property was found to lack proper guarding while the other had not been certified for use.Sharon and Scott Taylor were waiting in line with their children at the time. Scott said that the injuries were clearly severe as the paramedics began helping her. He added, &quot;Her clothing had wrapped around her neck&quot;. &quot;The cart hit the wall and stopped and she was just slumped over,&quot; remarked Sharon.Dadoun was the mother of two children, aged six and four. According to her aunt, she was a devoted caregiver and had been always willing to help others. More specifically, she remarked, &quot;If anyone needed help, she wouldn't say no. She did a lot for everybody - for her friends, her family, her relatives.&quot; Strongly said, &quot;You can't describe Mariam. She was the best.&quot;
