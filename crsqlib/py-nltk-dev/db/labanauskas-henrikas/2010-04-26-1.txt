29-year-old William Trubridge from New Zealand set a new freediving record on Sunday, reaching a depth of 116 metres (380 feet) in the Atlantic Ocean, holding his breath for four minutes nine seconds &mdash; breaking the world record for the deepest free immersion dive.Wearing a silicon-coated wetsuit, Trubridge plunged into world's deepest blue hole in a bay west of Clarence Town on Long Island, Bahamas. Dean's Blue Hole is 202 metres (663 ft) deep. Using breaststroke and fins to decend, he said &ldquo;It was hard to get the tag from the bottom as I struggled with some narcosis&quot;. &quot;[I] wasted some time fumbling for the tag, then set off for the surface. I had to use my arms a little from 20m&quot;.Trubridge already held nine world records, and the dive put him into first place in the &quot;Vertical Blue Suunto Dive-Off&quot; competition. Earlier in the tournament he broke the record for a &quot;constant weight, no fins&quot; unassisted dive to 92m (301ft) &mdash; the first person to reach the 300ft unaided.There are many different classes of freediving. For breath-hold diving, there is with- and without-fins, and with/without 'assistance', such as a weighted sled.This record was for &quot;Constant Weight Apnea with fins&quot;, where the diver cannot drop any weights during the dive, and follows a guide line, but cannot touch it. They may use fins to descend, but on the ascent they pull themselves up with the rope. Divers retrieve a velcro tag from a metal plate placed at a certain depth. The record was previously held by Austrian Herbert Nitsch, who reached a depth of 92m (301ft) on 19 April 2010. The 'no limits' record, in which competitors can use a weighted sled, is 214m (702 ft).
