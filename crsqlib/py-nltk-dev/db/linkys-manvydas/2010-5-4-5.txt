 California senator Jenny Oropeza, a Democrat and author of the bill, stated this is "already being done at more than 100 local cities and counties statewide." Oropeza wrote in a statement, "I'm sorry the governor did not agree with this widely supported effort to increase public awareness about the environmental threats carelessly tossed cigarettes are doing to our marine life and to the great outdoors" The bill, called Senate Bill 4, would have allowed for a US$ 100 for potential violators.
