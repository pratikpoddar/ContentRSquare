 American metal singer Ronnie James Dio died today at the age of 67, as announced by his wife, Wendy. Dio passed at 07:45 ( CST ) (13:45 UTC ) at the Mayo Clinic, an American disease treatment center, after a two-year fight with stomach cancer that caused him to stop singing while he received treatment. "Ronnie knew how much he was loved by all...Please know he loved you all and his music will live on forever," added his wife in a statement on Dio's website.  Dio (born Ronnie James Padavona) was born in July 10, 1942 in the American city of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. He was most noted for his high pitched vocals and lyrical tales involving battles and themes of good versus evil.  He performed with several hard rock and metal groups, but he was most notable for his first act, when he joined as singer of the British metal group Black Sabbath after lead singer and frontman Ozzy Osbourne left the band in 1979. Before Black Sabbath he performed with several less successful bands, including Rainbow, led by former Deep Purple 's Ritchie Blackmore, and Elf.  He also had a very successful solo career under the simple name "Dio", and had recently reunited with former Black Sabbath band mates under the moniker Heaven and Hell. Some of Dio's hit songs were " Holy Diver ", " Neon Knights ", and " The Last In Line ".
