From the fifth minute of the third quarter, the game belonged to Traralgon.Tim Aitkin kicked six of his nine goals in the last quarter to help Traralgon stamp their authority on the game.Sale upset ladder leaders Maffra at home. One could have argued that Maffra's inaccurate kicking in the second half cost it the win.To the end of the third, Maffra lead but could not close out the match. Sale won the match with a goal from a free kick after the full time siren.
