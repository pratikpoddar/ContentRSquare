A "very dangerous" inmate whose convictions include rape and murder has escaped from Tembisa Hospital in South Africa. 29-year-old Andries Gamba Msimang, from Mozambique, absconded on Friday.
Jailed in September 2009, Msimang "is serving a life sentence for murder, robbery, rape and house breaking with intent to rob and kidnap," says the Department of Correctional Services. The Department urges the public to summon police help if they see the escapee and not attempt to apprehend him themselves.
The Department further explained the man has been in hospital since Tuesday when he suffered a stroke. Two corrections officers left to guard the prisoner in hospital have been suspended and their employer says they "may face charges of gross negligence and dereliction of responsibility."
Police and the Department of Corrections are working together to try and return the killer to custody.
