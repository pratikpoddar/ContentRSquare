Reports indicate two people have been shot at Southampton Eastern Docks, England.
According to initial reports, a firearms incident has occurred on or close to HMS Astute, a submarine which was berthed in the docks. The incident is thought to have occurred a short time before 1212 BST when police were called to the docks.
"Hampshire police were called by their Ministry of Defense colleagues at 12.12 pm (1112 GMT) today... and are currently liaising with them to establish the exact circumstances of the incident," said a Hampshire Constabulary spokesperson in a statement to the Reuters news agency, "[i]t is believed two people have sustained injuries as a result of gun shots being discharged on the vessel."
An eyewitness at the scene told BBC News: "I saw at least six people carry a stretcher off the gangway into a waiting ambulance." An area around the docks has been sealed off.
Although serious, Hampshire Constabulary and the Ministry of Defence have stated that the incident is not terrorist related and that there is no public safety risk. Both organisations are continuing to investigate the incident.
Hampshire Constabulary later confirmed that one of the injured has died, and that one arrest has been made. It is believed that the arrested man is service personnel, and is currently being held in custody by the police.
