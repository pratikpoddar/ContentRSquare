All around Australia, ordinary people have celebrated Australia Day. Australia Day, on January 26 each year, is commemorated as Invasion Day by many indigenous Australians. In 2009, it coincided with Lunar New Year, celebrated by many Asian cultures.
Thousands of people have celebrated Australia Day with barbecues, concerts and boat races. Police expected half a million people to flock to the Hyde Park and the Harbour.

From 4:30 pm local time, police in Queensland's Sunshine Coast received calls from residents about loud drunken parties. Police arrested at least five people in a Noosaville park with another unit needing backup at Gympie Terrace (Noosa).
But, it was not all bad news for Sunshine Coast residents as thousands showed up to watch the "dunny races" at Aussie World. The crowd cheered as the final got under way. Maroochy Roos Australian Football team won.
A dunny race is contested by four people pushing an outhouse, an outdoors toilet, on wheels.

South Africa defeated Australia in their Limited Overs International in Adelaide, wrapping up the series of five cricket matches in the process. Batting first, Australia were all out for 222 runs off 48 overs. South Africa easily made the 223 target with more than 11 overs left.
"Once again, as has happened in the first three games, we lost wickets in a clump in the middle of the innings," Australian captain Ricky Ponting said. The match's highest scoring batsman was AB de Villiers with 82 runs not out.
