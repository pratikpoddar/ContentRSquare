Two people have been killed as the result of a collision involving a vehicle crashing into a tree in Oxfordshire, England. The two occupants of the Subaru Impreza were four-year-old Bradley Eldridge and his father, 36-year-old Tony Eldridge, who was driving the vehicle. Both were thought to be from the village of Bicester.
The vehicle was travelling between the Oxfordshire villages of Bicester and Bucknell at around 20:15 GMT on Wednesday when it departed from the road and crashed into a tree. Both occupents of the car were declared dead at the scene of the collision.
A rapid response ambulance had been directed to the crash site, however, a spokesperson for the South Central Ambulance Service stated that "[s]adly, there was nothing that the crews could do." The spokesperson also commented that "[a]n adult male and a four-year-old child were declared dead at the scene and our crew was stood down."
A spokesperson for the Thames Valley Police was quoted as saying: "A police officer came across the vehicle while out on patrol. It was a significant impact and he immediately raised the alarm before going to the aid of the occupants. It is unclear at this stage when the accident happened but it is not believed to have been long before it was found."
