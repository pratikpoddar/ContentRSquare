According to The Sun , the 45-year-old women was drinking alcohol from a secret stash. Cabin crew restrained her over disruption; she was handcuffed to her seat over the alleged assault.Brett Kenyon, 27, a passenger, said she was 'shouting incoherently... She went for them [crew] and hit one of the male stewards. He had a big shiner. Even when police took her she was struggling and tried to run off.'Thomson Airways released a statement saying the flight had diverted 'following an incident involving a female passenger.
