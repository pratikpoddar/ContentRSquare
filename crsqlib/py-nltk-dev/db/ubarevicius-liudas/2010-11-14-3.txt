A father shot his two daughters and wife, then committed suicide yesterday in Erie , Western Pennsylvania according to police.The Erie police responded to a call from the house at 11 a.m. on Saturday and found a 29-year-old man, a 27-year-old woman and two children, ages four and seven dead of gunshot wounds. A two-year old boy was hospitalised with minor injuries; he was reportedly shot in the ear.A resident, Kevin Klino, who lives one block away from the crime scene and heads the Citizens Reunited Against Crime group told the Associated Press , 'I was outside just leaving my house when I heard gunfire, four, five, or six shots... and seconds later, cop cars came flying by.' Klino was quick to talk to the police and informed the community that a gunman was not on the loose, rather, a suspected murder-suicide.Klino also added, 'This is an impoverished neighborhood with a lot of good people in it. People were just walking through the neighborhood stunned. It"s not even a tragedy, it"s worse than that... when you"ve got kids involved, it just numbs you, shocks you'
