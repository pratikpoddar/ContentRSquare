Norton Fredrick, the Sri Lankan cricketer who played for the national All Ceylon team during the 1960s, has died at the age of 73. He died in his home town of Wattala after suffering from a terminal illness. He played for the Bloomfield Cricket and Athletic Club as well as nationally for the All Ceylon team, before Sri Lanka had test status.
During his national career he played against nations such as Pakistan, Australia, and India. A skilled fast bowler he spoke about his first match saying â€œIt was a very memorable baptism for me. The match was played at the Colombo Oval â€“ Sara Stadium. I bowled well and took a hat-trick. I still remember the three victims â€“ R. Ramesh, V. V. Kumara and G. Thomas. I played two Gopalan games in 1964 and 1965. It was a wonderful experience. We played for the love of the game.â€
During an unofficial test match against India in 1965 he set up a four-wicket win after taking seven wickets. This was the first time that the All Ceylon team had won against India. His national career was ended in 1968 after family commitments forced him to end his career.
Fredrick is survived by his wife and a son. Another son served as an army officer and died during the Sri Lankan civil war. Fredrick's death comes in the same month as Gamini Goonasena, another former Sri Lankan cricketer who died at the age of 80.
