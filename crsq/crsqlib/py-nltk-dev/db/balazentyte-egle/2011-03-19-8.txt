After French aircraft began missions over Libya, attacks from the United States and United Kingdom have begun. Upwards of 110 Tomahawk missiles have been fired by US and UK warships and submarines in the Mediterranean Sea. Targets include the capitol of Tripoli and military installations around the country. The attacks have been code-named "Operation Odyssey Dawn." In addition to French aircraft, David Cameron said that British aircraft are also taking part in airstrikes. Cameron said that "Gaddafi has made this happen. He has lied to the international community. He has promised a ceasefire. He has broken that ceasefire. He continues to brutalise his own people. The time for action has come." Gaddafi has issued a letter to several international leaders in which he said that "Libya is not yours. Libya is for the Libyans. The security council resolution is invalid. You will regret it if you dare to intervene in our country."
