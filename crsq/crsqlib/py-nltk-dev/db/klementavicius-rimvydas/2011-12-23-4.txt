Citizens in Israel who participated in the 2010 'Freedom Flotilla' to Gaza will not be prosecutedaccording to a statement released today by the Attorney General of IsraelYehuda Weinstein.
Weinstein said the cases had been closed due to "evidentiary and legal difficulties" related to "proving the basis of the office as well as legal questions regarding the jurisdiction of Israeli law on crimes committed abroad."
Haneen Zoabian Israeli Arab and member of the Knesset for the Balad partywas amongst the Israeli citizens who participated in the flotilla. She responded to the dropping of the cases by saying that it "proves what I said all along. My participation in the flotilla was a political act and entirely legal."
