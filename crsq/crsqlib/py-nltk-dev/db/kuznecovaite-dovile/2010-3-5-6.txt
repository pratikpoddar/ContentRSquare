 Buffalo, New York â€” Production was temporarily halted at the General Mills cereal plant in Buffalo, New York after malfunctioning equipment exploded, causing a fire.  According to communications between fire crews, a fan in a hopper exploded on the 4th floor just before midnight ( EST ). Fire crews responded within minutes, but the fire had been extinguished prior to their arrival. Fire crews say that a 'faulty motor in a hopper' exploded, igniting dust around the equipment which caused a fire. The explosion forced the company to shut down all of their mills and power to most of their facility for a short time as a precaution. Production and normal operations began to resume around 12:15 a.m.. No one was injured. Fire officials estimate the damage to be around US$ 100,000.
