 The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is looking into threats made against Democratic members of the US House of Representatives . The threats were directed at members of Congress who supported the recent health care reform legislation.  Virginia"s 5th district representative Tom Perriello "s brother"s home had its gas line cut early Wednesday. Another Democrat, Louise Slaughter of New York"s 28th district , had a brick thrown through her offices window.  House Majority leader Steny Hoyer held a press conference about the threats and multiple instances of vandalism involving the offices of Congresspersons who voted on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act . Hoyer said that '[t]he incidents of threats whether in person or through telephones or through other communication devices, have given great concern to members, for the safety of themselves and their families.'  House Minority leader John Boehner said that the incidents show the American peoples" feelings for the new bill, but 'violence and threats are unacceptable.' He added, 'that"s not the American way, we need to take that anger and channel it into positive change.'
