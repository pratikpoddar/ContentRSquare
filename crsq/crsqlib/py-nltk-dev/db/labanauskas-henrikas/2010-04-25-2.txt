Paul Sch&auml;fer died at 88 from cardiac-respiratory arrest on early Saturday morning in a Chilean prison hospital. Sch&auml;fer was the founder and former leader of Colonia Dignidad, an enclave used for torturing and exterminating political prisoners during Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. Hr was convicted for sexually abusing 26 children for years, and retained thousands of people under his own tyrannical regime, that worked as an aside territory in the country, where people spoke the German language.Jorge Zepeda, magistrate who investigated the crimes made in Colonia Dignidad, reported that Sch&auml;fer was unconscious when he died. He was to stay in prison for 33 years. Hern&aacute;n Fern&aacute;ndez, one of the lawyers against Colonia Dignidad, said that Sch&auml;fer's death should help to accelerate the judiciary processes. Chilean President, Sebasti&aacute;n Pi&ntilde;era said, &quot;Paul Sch&auml;fer will be judged by the divine justice.&quot;Sch&auml;fer was born in 1921, in Siegburg, Germany. He was a non-commissioned Nazi officer, who moved to Chile after the Second World War, evading accusations of sexual abuse of minors. He established an organization in a rural area of Chile, in favour of the poor people, located 400 kilometers south of Santiago, to the border of Argentina. He named this place Villa Babiera.He began his rule of this area in 1961; he established a private tyrannical regime, where almost 300 Germans worked for decades without pay. Men and women were segregated, and people who tried to escape were killed. Adults and children considered it an &quot;honour&quot; for Sch&auml;fer to chose to have sex with them.When Pinochet's regime ended, Sch&auml;fer escaped from Chile in 1996 to avoid being imprisoned, after he came under investigation for human rights violations and abuse to minors. He was detained in Argentina, and then extradited back to Chile in 2005. Since then he was imprisoned. Colonia Dignidad still exists, though without the power they had before, less secluded and with new leaders.
