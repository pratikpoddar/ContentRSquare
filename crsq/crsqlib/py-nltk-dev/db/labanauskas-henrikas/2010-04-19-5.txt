A joint military operation by Iraqi and American forces has killed two senior al-Qaeda leaders in Iraq, according to Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Malaki and US officials.The leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Ayyub al-Masri, and the leader of an affiliate group, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, were killed by Iraqi military forces with assistance from US forces in a night-time attack on a safe house. According to Prime Minister Malaki, &quot;The attack was carried out by ground forces which surrounded the house, and also through the use of missiles.&quot; The two were killed in Thar-Thar, in the province of Salaheddin, 50 miles west of Iraq's capital, Baghdad.The American commander of military forces in Iraq, General Raymond Odierno, said in a statement that &quot;the death of these terrorists is potentially the most significant blow to al-Qaeda in Iraq since the beginning of the insurgency.&quot; In a separate statement, the US said that the two Iraqis were killed in battle after &quot;engaging the security team.&quot; Additionally, two other people were killed&mdash;an assistant of al-Masri and the son of al-Baghdadi.Al-Masri, along with Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who was killed in 2006, formed the first al-Qaeda cell in Baghdad, which have been responsible for many attacks since the US invasion of the country in 2003. Al-Baghdadi was the leader of an umbrella group, the Islamic State of Iraq, a group that is partly composed of radical Sunni militant groups.
