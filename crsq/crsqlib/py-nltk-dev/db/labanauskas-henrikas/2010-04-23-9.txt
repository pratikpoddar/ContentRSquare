Minas, one of the largest states of Brazil, has stopped the sale of the Toyota Corolla over safety concerns.The move was made after nine Corolla customers reported that their cars automatically accelerated. The state public prosecutor's office said in an online statement on Tuesday that the problem is blamed on accelerator pedals sticking underneath floor mats. Local government said the issue was &quot;putting in danger the lives of occupants&quot;.According to the prosecutor's office, sales of Corollas may resume when Toyota alters the floormats in its current models. Toyota has recalled over eight million vehicles worldwide due to acceleration problems.
