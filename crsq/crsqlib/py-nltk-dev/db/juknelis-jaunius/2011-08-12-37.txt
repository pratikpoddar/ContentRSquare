Former Australian Member of Parliament Karen Overington has died at the age of 59. Her death followed a long battle with ill health. Overington was the Member of Parliament for Ballarat West with the Labor Party from 1999 until she stood down in 2010. During her political career, Overington worked to improve living standards for the community's disadvantage.
Tributes have flown in for Overington from both her political colleagues and opponents. Premier of Victoria Ted Baillieu said â€œOn behalf of the Victorian Coalition government, I express sincere condolences to family, friends and parliamentary colleagues on both sides of the Parliament, Karen was always a passionate representative of the Labor Party, the people of Ballarat and the people of Victoria.â€
Opposition leader Daniel Andrews also commented: â€œShe stood up for her community, lobbying strongly to deliver better education, health and other services that have made a real difference to families in Ballarat West." Sharon Knight, the woman who won the parliamentary seat in Ballarat West after Overington stood down, praised her, saying, â€œshe epitomised a real local member.â€
Overington is survived by her two children.
