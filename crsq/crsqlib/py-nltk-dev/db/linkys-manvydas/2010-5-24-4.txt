 The Gippsland Football League 's (officially Gippsland League) representative team traveled to Bendigo to play the hosts as part of the Victorian Country Football League Country Championships over the weekend. The match was part of a double header with Murray Football League playing Bellarine Football League in the curtain raiser. The VCFL's Country Championships is an interleague competition where each of the sixteen major leagues as well as the Mallee, Horsham &#38; District, Geelong &#38; District and Heathcote-District leagues are ranked from one to twenty. A league is promoted if they win, demoted if they lose.Kane Fraser (Sale), Kal Killoran (Maffra) and Tim Aitken (Traralgon) were called into the Gippsland team after injuries and illness to Sale forward Brenton Martin, Morwell coach Adrian Cox and Traralgon's Micheal Geary.

Inaccurate goal kicking from Gippsland cost the visitors the match as Bendigo won 15-11 (101) to Gippsland's 12-20 (92). Had three of Gippsland's behinds gone through the goals, they would have won by one goal (six points).Dwayne Holt with five goals and Chris Dunne with two goals were the only multiple goal kickers for the visitors. For Bendigo, Justin Maddern with four goals and Grant Weeks and Steven Stroobants with two goals each were the multiple goal kickers.
