 At least seven policemen were killed in northeastern Afghanistan yesterday, according to reports, after a bomb went off near a police patrol vehicle.  The incident occurred in the Darayim district within the province of Badakhshan, considered to be the least violent province in the country. Another policeman was injured, and subsequently evacuated to a provincial hospital; deputy provincial governor Shams-Ul Rahman Shams said his condition is apparently critical. Afghan Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack. Meanwhile, in a separate incident, an Afghan army convoy full of soldiers struck upon another roadside bomb in Nangarhar, killing a further three people.
