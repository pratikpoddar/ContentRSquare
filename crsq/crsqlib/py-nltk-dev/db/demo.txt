Tom played with John and Mary. Someone else drove to the school and ate the bread. He also starved for eight minutes - really long...
John was not in the mood to visit Patrick in London. Anyway it's a great day for him and his dog Barky.
Suzzy  went to school, Bob wen to school too. They both were teenagers. Somehow none of them liked Bob Marley.
Who cares, if this lab work sucks, as long as it's perfect. Go and point out that Tom did a good job. Katty Perry was ill and skipped the lessons, however she has done all her duties for today. Most of the people drink & sleep, but not John Goliath
