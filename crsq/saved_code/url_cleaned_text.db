There is no way I\u2019m going to be a burden to them.\u201d\n\nThe drug, Herceptin, is one of the most effective treatments for an aggressive form of breast cancer. But in India, at a cost of at least $18,000 for one course of treatment, only a small fraction of the women who need it get it.\n\nThe Indian government last year threatened to allow production of less costly, generic versions of Herceptin. Its maker, Roche Holdings of Switzerland, initially resisted, but surrendered its patent rights this year in large measure because it concluded that it would lose a legal contest in Indian courts.\n\nThe skirmishing over Herceptin and other cancer medicines is part of a new and critical phase in a struggle to make drugs affordable to the world\u2019s poorest people, one that began in earnest more than a decade ago when advocates campaigned successfully to make AIDS medicines accessible to millions of Africans.\n\n\u201cCancer is the next H.I.V./AIDS issue, and the fight has only begun,\u201d said Shamnad Basheer, a professor of law at West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences in Kolkata.\n\nAmerican trade officials have voiced concerns about India\u2019s treatment of drug patents, including its reasons for sometimes overriding them. President Obama discussed the issue this year with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India in the Oval Office, administration officials said.\n\nExecutives in the international pharmaceutical industry, increasingly dependent on drug sales in emerging markets like India, China and Brazil, contend that India\u2019s efforts to cancel patents threaten the global system for discovering cures while doing little to resolve the health challenges most patients here face.\n\n\u201cWe are open to discussing what the best way is to bring innovative medicines to patients,\u201d said Daniel Grotzky, a spokesman for Roche, which has a large portfolio of cancer medicines. \u201cBut a society that wants to develop new medicines and technology must reward innovation through a solid protection of intellectual property.\u201d\n\nSome health experts say investing in earlier diagnosis of breast cancer and improved testing, surgery and access to radiation therapy is more important than access to expensive drugs. \u201cChemotherapy is not the major issue for cancer control in India,\u201d said Dr. Richard Sullivan, a professor of cancer policy and global health at King\u2019s Health Partners\u2019 Integrated Cancer Center in London.\n\nBut health advocates say similar arguments were made by the United States government and the pharmaceutical industry as they sought to protect patents on AIDS medicines through much of the 1990s, a stance that former President Bill Clinton has since said he regrets. It would be unfair to delay improving access to cancer drugs until India\u2019s broken system for cancer care was fixed, they say. They note that more than twice as many people in India die of cancer than of AIDS.\n\nAs the world has made progress against malnutrition and infectious diseases, more people are living into old age and dying of chronic illnesses like heart disease and cancer, which now cause two-thirds of deaths globally. In 2012, there were 14.1 million new cancer cases across the world and 8.2 million cancer deaths, according to the World Health Organization. And the number of breast cancer cases is growing. About 6.3 million women were living with the disease last year.\n\nThe rise in the cancer caseload is already a heavy burden on India\u2019s hobbled health system. Indian women, while less likely to get breast cancer than those in the United States, are far more likely to die of it. Breast cancer is diagnosed in about 115,000 women here every year, and in 2008 some 54,000 died from it, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nAt intersections in New Delhi, women carrying doctors\u2019 notes beg for money for their prescribed treatments. India has just 27 dedicated public cancer centers for 1.2 billion people. The government has promised to add an additional 50 in the coming years, but medical experts say even that will be grossly inadequate.\n\nIndia, which is one of the world\u2019s leading producers of generic pharmaceuticals, has long viewed patent rights on medicines skeptically. It has already ruled invalid patents protecting exclusive sales of Novartis\u2019s Gleevec, Pfizer\u2019s Sutent and Roche\u2019s Tarceva, all cancer medicines. In a landmark decision last year, the government agreed that the patent protecting Bayer\u2019s Nexavar, also a cancer drug, was valid but overrode it anyway because a generic company promised to lower the price from $4,500 to about $140 per month of treatment.", "http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/30/the-twitter-nyse-honeymoon-is-over-as-stock-price-takes-another-nosedive/": "Today at market opening, Twitter shares (NYSE:TWTR) dropped once again. Shares were at $60.27, down 5.46 percent compared to Friday\u2019s closing price of $63.75. This nosedive marks the end of the honeymoon between Twitter and the NYSE as many analysts stated that shares are overpriced. Until now, the stock held strong amid those reports, but that seems to be coming to an end.\n\nIt is not the first drop as shares were already down 13 percent on Friday, shaving $5 billion off Twitter\u2019s market capitalization. It was a big correction of Thursday\u2019s good performance \u2014 on Thursday, shares popped 5 percent for no apparent reason.\n\nMany analysts find that Twitter is an expensive company. With a market cap of $33.6 billion, the company has yet to turn a profit \u2014 analysts don\u2019t expect to see any profit before 2015. But this pessimistic trend on the analyst\u2019s side seems to be increasing. On Friday, Macquarie analyst Ben Schachter downgraded Twitter.\n\nAccording to Bespoke Investment Group, the average price target stands at $44.27, around 37 percent below today\u2019s trading price.\n\nBut why is the stock price dropping today? The Twitter IPO was a great sign for the entire tech industry. Private companies saw that the stock market could be friendly again with tech companies \u2014 and now, everyone wants to IPO.\n\nWhen Twitter became a public company on November 7, the company priced its IPO at $26 a share. Shares popped 74 percent on that day. After this very good IPO performance, the stock price has been relatively flat.\n\nMany commented that the IPO was underpriced on purpose to make a big splash on the NYSE. Leaving money on the table was a way to improve the longterm prospects and overall image. Shares are still up around 135 percent compared to the IPO price.\n\nYet, there was a recent turning point for Twitter shares. When the company introduced retargeted ads in early December, the advertising industry was very enthusiastic. Ads would soon be more relevant thanks to browser cookies and more user information. And shareholders voted with their wallets.\n\nShares went from $44.95 on December 6 to $73.31 on December 26. It represents a 63.1 percent increase, or a $15.7 billion increase in market capitalization. But it wasn\u2019t sustainable on the long run. This 3-week honeymoon was great while it lasted, but it\u2019s time to come back to reality.\n\nUpdate at 9:45 am (ET): Shares are now down 7.22 percent to $59.15 a share.", "http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/29/reason-152-virtual-reality-is-awesome-personal-movie-theaters-without-the-awful-other-people/": "I love going to the movie theater. Seriously, I love it.\n\nI just hate all the other people that go.\n\nQuite early on, my parents taught me that there was but one rule for going to the theater: silence is golden. If the theater was a moviegoer\u2019s church, talking or otherwise ruining the experience for others was sin. If I talked, we\u2019d leave. Simple as that.\n\nSometime in the past few years, though, it\u2019s like people have forgotten how to do the movie theater.\n\nI\u2019ve tried going at different times. I\u2019ve tried going to different theaters. No matter what I do, no matter where I go, the shitty moviegoers follow. They talk. They crack jokes that only their friends laugh at. They muck with their phones, blinding everyone in the rows behind them so they can blast out a Facebook update about being at the movies that literally no one will care about.\n\nI went to 10 movies this year; 9 out of 10 had at least one person who happily paid their $12 just to go in and crap on the movie for everyone else. I\u2019ve given up.\n\nBut this\u2026 this gives me hope. Hope for a next-best-thing. And man does it make me want an HD Oculus Rift like right now.\n\nVR Cinema 3D is a movie theater\u2026 simulator. Built with the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset in mind, it\u2019s a simulated movie theater without the lines, the massively inflated concession prices, or the crappy people. It\u2019s a full-sized movie theater in the comfort of your own home, beamed straight to your eyeballs.\n\nYou strap on the Rift, load up your favorite movie (by naming it \u201cmovie.avi\u201d, regardless of what sort of video file it actually is. Hurray, beta software!), pick any seat in the house, and kick back. The \u201cin-theater\u201d lights dim, and the projector starts rolling \u2014 complete with a bit of ambient light reflecting off the screen and back into the room.\n\nDon\u2019t like your seat? Walk to another, or bring up the UI to instantly warp across the room.\n\nIt may seem silly, at first glance. Why simulate the environment? Why not just play the video directly onto the Rift\u2019s display?\n\nOnce you try it, though, it all makes sense. The familiar environment helps it all feel very, very real, allowing you to quickly lose yourself in the movie. Meanwhile, simulating the screen at a realistic distance gives it all a massive sense of scale.\n\nJust imagine this with a bit of networking magic added in. You and your friends could catch the latest flicks while sitting side-by-side, even when you\u2019re thousands of miles apart. And if one of them starts talking a bit too much? Boop! Muted.\n\nOf all the Oculus Rift demos I\u2019ve tried, this one might actually be my favorite. They hooked me initially with the promise of immersive games, but they sold me forever with the promise of private theaters.\n\nIf you have a Rift, you can find the early (and occasionally buggy) build of VR Cinema here. Sorry, Mac users \u2013 it\u2019s Windows only, for now.\n\nStill not getting it? Here\u2019s a slightly longer video of the app in use by Youtuber/Rifter emart:", "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/nyregion/de-blasio-is-said-to-choose-schools-chancellor.html?hp": "Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio will appoint Carmen Fari\u00f1a, a former top official of the New York City Education Department, as the next schools chancellor, a person with knowledge of the decision said on Sunday.\n\nMs. Fari\u00f1a, 70, the daughter of immigrants from Spain who fled the Franco regime, is a veteran of the city\u2019s school system, having served as a teacher, principal and superintendent of a Brooklyn school district. She retired as a deputy chancellor in 2006.\n\nThe choice reflected Mr. de Blasio\u2019s desire to depart radically from the educational policies of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, including his emphasis on data and his policy of shuttering low-performing schools. The choice is also in keeping with Mr. de Blasio\u2019s pattern of appointing people with deep governmental experience.\n\nAs a principal and superintendent, Ms. Fari\u00f1a gained a reputation as a stern manager. She worked briefly as a top official in the Education Department early in the Bloomberg administration, overseeing teaching and learning, but departed amid philosophical differences.\n\nLast year, when he was a Democrat in a crowded field of mayoral contenders, Mr. de Blasio said that candidates for chancellor should receive \u201cserious public screening,\u201d criticizing the way Mr. Bloomberg had appointed Cathleen P. Black, a publishing executive, as chancellor in 2010. She resigned after three months.\n\nAs the leader of the nation\u2019s largest school district, with 1 million students, Ms. Fari\u00f1a will also face a host of thorny issues, including calming tensions over a new set of academic standards, rolling out a plan to charge rent to charter schools and negotiating a contract with the city\u2019s teachers\u2019 union, which is demanding billions of dollars in retroactive raises.\n\nMr. de Blasio has spoken often about his desire to break with several hallmarks of the Bloomberg era, including its support of charter schools. He has said he will decrease the emphasis on standardized testing and give more input to parents.\n\nMs. Fari\u00f1a shares Mr. de Blasio\u2019s skepticism of standardized testing and his focus on early education. As chancellor, she will help shape his proposal to expand access to preschool and after-school programs.\n\nThe announcement was expected on Monday at William Alexander Middle School in Brooklyn.\n\nReached at her home late Sunday, Ms. Fari\u00f1a declined to comment. Aides to Mr. de Blasio did not respond Sunday night to a request for comment.\n\nMs. Fari\u00f1a brings to the office a deep knowledge of New York City and its schools. In a 1999 interview, she recalled being the only Spanish-speaking student in kindergarten at St. Charles Borromeo, a parochial school in Brooklyn. She was marked absent by a teacher for six weeks because her teacher mispronounced her name.\n\nMs. Fari\u00f1a initially resisted the prospect of being chancellor, saying publicly that she was content in retirement and eager to spend time with her grandchildren. But in recent weeks, Mr. de Blasio continued to prod her.\n\n\u201cBill is a very persuasive person,\u201d Ms. Fari\u00f1a said in an interview this month.\n\n\u201cMy grandchildren are important to me,\u201d she added. \u201cI spent a lot of years in the system. But I will do whatever the new mayor wants me to do.\u201d\n\nThe search for chancellor stretched on for almost two months. It was considered one of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s most important appointments, given the emphasis he placed on education during his mayoral bid, including his signature prekindergarten proposal.\n\nBut the process of picking a chancellor did not always appear easy. Several candidates withdrew from the process, including Kaya Henderson, chancellor of the schools in Washington, D.C. Other high-profile contenders included Joshua P. Starr, who leads Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland, and Kathleen M. Cashin, a longtime city educator and member of the Board of Regents.\n\nMs. Fari\u00f1a has stood out throughout her career with her blunt style and egalitarian ideals.\n\nShe became known within the system as a principal at Public School 6 on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, drawing wealthy families into the school. In 2004, she was named a deputy chancellor, but departed two years later, uneasy about the growing use of student test scores to evaluate schools.\n\nAt P.S. 6, Ms. Fari\u00f1a turned a school once ranked as 76th on a citywide reading test to fourth. Her strategy included replacing 80 percent of the staff \u2014 a difficult task, given tenure protections for teachers. \u201cOnce you create a climate in a building that is hard-working, people will find out whether they are comfortable with it or not,\u201d she explained in 1999. \u201cAnd then they have decisions to make.\u201d\n\nAs a principal, Ms. Fari\u00f1a had a soft side, offering to preside over classes for teachers on their birthdays, so they could go to lunch.\n\nSince her retirement in 2006, Ms. Fari\u00f1a has emerged as a critic of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s educational policies. \u201cI want to see us have a system where people do things because they have a sense of joy about it, not because they have a sense of fear,\u201d she said at a speech in November, according to the education blog GothamSchools.\n\nIt was unclear how long Ms. Fari\u00f1a planned to remain as chancellor. Mr. de Blasio had at one point considered appointing a deputy who might succeed her after a year or two, according to a person with knowledge of the process. But one such candidate, Dr. Starr, said he was not interested in the position, the person said."}
