The United States Senate has unanimously confirmed Earl Anthony Wayne as the new U.S ambassador to Mexico. He replaces Carlos Pascual, who resigned in March following a dispute with Mexican President Felipe CalderÃ³n.
Wayne's nomination had been pending since June, and in late July the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the nomination. Before the confirmation he said â€œOne of my principal objectives...will be to work with my Mexican and U.S. colleagues to accelerate the implementation of the activities to assure that we are achieving our MÃ©rida objectives.â€
Wayne has previously served as the U.S ambassador to Argentina and as the deputy ambassador to Afghanistan.
Speaking about the Senate's choice of Wayne as a candidate for the ambassador's role, Eric Olson, a senior associate at the Mexico Institute of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars said â€œThey didnâ€™t want a controversial candidate. If you choose someone who is more of a political appointee than a career foreign service officer it can get caught up in the politics of the situation. [With Wayne] youâ€™re not picking someone out of the blue or somebody that the committee is not familiar with."
