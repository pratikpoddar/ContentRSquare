Three days after violent protests, which saw the deaths of 81 and injury to some 1600 people, calm has returned to Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan.Following the protests which led to President Kurmanbek Bakiyev fleeing the capital, a self-styled interim government led by former foreign minister Roza Otunbayeva was established last Thursday. The interim government, Bakiyev, and his supporters, who are believed to be in the south of the country, are described as now being at a &quot;first contacts&quot; stage by OSCE envoy Zhanybek Karibzhanov.A vital logistics hub to the United States and coalition forces in the war in Afghanistan, the interim government has been described by US officials as being committed to honouring existing security agreements. However, Almazbek Atambayev, the first deputy head of the acting government, is reported to have flown to Moscow in order to secure emergency aid in the wake of the collapse of the Kyrgyz economy.
