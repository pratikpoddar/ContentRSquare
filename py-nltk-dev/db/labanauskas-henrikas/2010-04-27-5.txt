A snap election in Nauru has failed to end a political deadlock. The election, called a year early by President Marcus Stephen, had all eighteen members of parliament re-elected. President Stephen&rsquo;s government is controlled by nine MP&rsquo;s with his opponent holding the same number.Because neither side can decide who should be speaker of the house, a government cannot be formed. Stephen&rsquo;s opponent had been trying to get rid of him for several months. Stephen will remain in power with a caretaker government.During his term in office, Stephen has been faced with numerous issues. Nauru was once one of the richest countries in the world, but due to bad investments has become one of the poorest. The country also has high rates of both obesity and unemployment.Since Nauru gained independence in 1968, there has been 36 changes in government.
