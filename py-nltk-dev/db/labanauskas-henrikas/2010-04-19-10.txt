The son of Illinois Senate President John Cullerton allegedly drove under the influence (DUI) early Sunday morning while using a state-funded vehicle. Local police report that 26-year-old Garritt M. Cullerton was pulled over in downtown Chicago shortly after midnight and registered a blood alcohol level of .188, more than twice the legal limit of .08.Chicago police spokeswoman Antoinette Ursitti told the local press that Cullerton has been charged with &quot;DUI, negligent driving and improper lane usage.&quot; He is to appear in court on May 26. Senator Cullerton's office confirmed that his son was driving a 2009 Ford Escape registered to the state Senate, and added that &quot;the Senate President is disappointed that this incident occurred and takes this matter very seriously. He will work to ensure that this does not occur in the future.&quot;John Cullerton in 2008 sponsored legislation that requires DUI offenders to prove that they are sober by blowing into an electronic device every time they want to start the car. One of the strictest in the country, this law primarily targets first-time offenders.
