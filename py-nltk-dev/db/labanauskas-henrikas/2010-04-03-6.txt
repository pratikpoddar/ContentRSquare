The opposition to the Chilean President Sebasti&aacute;n Pi&ntilde;era have criticized his management after the earthquake. Pi&ntilde;era however gave a stability message to the Chilean people last Wednesday. On Thursday morning, he announced that he would discontinue the &quot;catastrophe state&quot; declared in the most affected regions by the earthquake: O'Higgins, Maule and B&iacute;o B&iacute;o. He also emphasized the actions he has taken during the twenty days he has been as President.Pi&ntilde;era also said that the decree that declares as affected zones the Valpara&iacute;so, Santiago Metropolitan, O'Higgins, Maule, B&iacute;o B&iacute;o and Araucan&iacute;a regions will be kept in order to ease the aid plans, and military forces will stay in these areas.&quot;We've decided to keep the Armed Forces on the affected areas with a double purpose: they can still collaborate in aid humanitarian works with the enormous job to reconstruct what the earthquake and tsunami destroyed,&quot; said Pi&ntilde;era. &quot;We want to halt the delinquency, as we did last March 29 in the Day of the Combatant Young [D&iacute;a del Joven Combatiente],&quot; he added.He also said he was satisfied with the promulgation of the &quot;bono marzo&quot; (&quot;March bonus&quot;, a bonus of money that poor people will receive), one of his symbolic proposals for his government.
