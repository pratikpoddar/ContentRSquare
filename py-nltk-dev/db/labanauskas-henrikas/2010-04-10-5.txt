According to reports, three US soldiers and a civilian contractor have been killed in southern Afghanistan, when a US helicopter crashed. Other passengers aboard the aircraft were hurt, and were transferred to a medical base close by.According to a statement by the International Security Assistance Force, the crash happened about eleven kilometres west of the city of Qalat in the Zabul province late on Thursday. The helicopter that went down was a CV-22 Osprey.The cause of the crash is currently unclear, although a spokesman for the Taliban claimed responsibility for shooting it down. The Associated Press, however, says that the group frequently exaggerates claims.Marine Major Shawn Turner commented that this was the first time an Osprey went down in a war zone during operations.With this crash, a total of 151 foreign soldiers have been killed this year in Afghanistan.
