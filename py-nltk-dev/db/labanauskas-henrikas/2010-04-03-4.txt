However, other reports said as many as several hundred people were missing.According to local media, some dead bodies had been found and taken from the Huallaga River; other corpses were dug out of the mud.Jorge Espinoza, a senior official for Huanuco, remarked: &quot;An entire village, some 400 people, has completely vanished.
