 Bairnsdale will return to Gippsland's major Australian rules football league after members voted to join the Gippsland League (GL). The GL, East Gippsland Football League and the Victorian Country Football League , regional Victoria's governing Aussie rules body, have all approved the move. 
Bairnsdale will field teams in the seniors, under 18 and under 16 grades, but not a reserves side like the rest of the competition. Players not selected in the senior side will be able to play for a club in the East Gippsland minor league, under a unique transfer agreement. 
They will play their first game back in the major league in Warragul on April 9 before playing their first home game against Moe a week later. 
Their furthest away game will be to Wonthaggi â?? a one way trip of approximately 224 kilometres.
