Rescue efforts are underway to free more than 200 skiers trapped Tuesday at Maine 's Sugarloaf ski resort , which is located 120 miles north of Portland . Several injuries were reported after a ski lift broke down; an employee at the resort said this caused several people to fall to the ground. 
The Spillway East lift reportedly came to a halt during high winds due to a derailment. Around 10:30 a.m. ET, a cable slid over one tower's pulley leading to five chairs falling about 30 feet. 
Ethan Austin, a resort spokesperson, revealed that several individuals were taken to near-by hospitals with non-life-threatening conditions. At the time, winds originating from this month's blizzard were blowing up to 43 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service . Austin confirmed Tuesday afternoon that the lift was carrying around 220 people at the time of the breakdown. 
Efforts to remove trapped skiers are in progress Tuesday afternoon.
