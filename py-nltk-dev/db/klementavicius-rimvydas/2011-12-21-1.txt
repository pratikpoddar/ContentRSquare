James Hipwella former financial reporter for the Daily Mirror tabloidtold the Leveson Inquiry today he believed hacking into voicemails of celebrities and others was a "bog-standard tool" for entertainment journalists at the Mirror.
Hipwell was fired from the paper in 2000 and then convicted and sent to prison in February 2006 for using his "City Slicker" column in the newspaper to write about companies he had a financial stake inwhich netted him approximately £40,000. Trinity Mirror newspaperswhich publishes the Mirroralso publishes another tabloid The People which is also alleged to have used phone hacking to get stories.
Hipwell told the inquiry he believed that voicemail hacking was "genuinely accepted""happened every day" and "was entirely accepted by the senior editors on the newspaper" and that "it was seen as a slightly underhand thing to do but not illegal." He also stated "that a great number of the Mirror's showbusiness stories would come from that source" and that "showbiz hacks discussed techniques and products of hacking openly".
Hipwell's testimony contradicts claims by the former editor of the MirrorPiers Morganwho now hosts a talk show on CNN. Morgan claims that under his editorshiphe was unaware of any hackingbut Hipwell claims it is unlikely Morgan did not know about hacking going on at the paper.
The Leveson Inquiry was set up by the British Prime Minister David Cameron following the scandal which engulfed the News of the World after widespread allegations they hacked into voicemails of crime victims and their families including the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowlerand has so far interviewed numerous representatives of the media industryand alleged victims of press intrusion and phone hacking.
