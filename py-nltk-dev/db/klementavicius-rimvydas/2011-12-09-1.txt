The West Jakarta District Court has convicted six of a string of bombingsand responsibility for bomb alertsa year ago on Java and sent them to prison. It is believed the group wished to begin a holy war.
Prosecutors wanted eight years for 29-year-old ringleader Roki Aprisdianto but the court gave him a six-year sentence. His five co-accused followers - all students or graduates from Klaten's State Vocational School No. 2 - all received five yearsless than the seven years the prosecution wanted. Neither Aprisdianto nor the prosecution will appeal; the defence may yet appeal the other decisions.
Agung Jati Santoso21Tri Budi Santoso20Nugroho Budi Santoso19Yuda Anggoro19Joko Lelono18and Aprisdianto all saw convictions under anti-terrorism legislation from 2003. Their crimes began on December 12009 in Solowith unexploded bombs found at three churches and two police posts. The town's Kliwon Market was rocked by a small explosion and six days later so was a church.
These were followed by an unexploded bomb at a Yogyakarta mosque on December 23 and a Klaten bomb scare in which a cow excrement and a clock were left in another mosque. The convictions follow that of seventeen-year-old Arga Wiratamagiven a two-year sentence. The group was arrested in January.
Mitigation cited by the court for Aprisdianto's five followers included their young ages and their good conduct during the trial.
