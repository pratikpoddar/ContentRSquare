Over 50 people have been injured today when two trains collided head-on at the Bet-Yehoshua station, near the city of Netanya on the railway from Tel Aviv to Haifa. Most of the injuries are minor, with no casualties or serious injuries reported in the media.
The trains advanced slowly, one leaving the station and one entering it. One of the trains was completely derailed. The Israeli Railway Authority CEO said the accident was caused by a personal error of one of the conductors, but a police investigation is still ensuing.
This is the second serious accident for Israeli trains within half a year. Four months ago, a train car derailed and burst in flames, injuring 79 people, most of the injuries due to inhaling of smoke.
The Israel Railway Authority notified the passengers that the tracks from Tel Aviv to Haifa will be closed for at least a week, but later the company manager announced that rides would continue within 24 hours, while a fast and open investigation will follow. He promised that the results will be publicized immediately upon being received.
