 Three rebels in Indonesia , which authorities say were terror suspects, have been killed near the capital Jakarta in raids, which are apparently connected with an operation in Aceh against rebels.  One of the raids occurred at an internet cafe in Jakarta in the city of Palmulang According to the Associated Press , the suspected rebel had been on the internet for about five minutes when security officials entered; he fired a shot from a revolver, but police returned fire and killed him. In the other raid, police shot and killed two suspects from the same rebel group, who were on a motorcycle apparently fleeing, according to National Police spokesman Edward Aritonang, adding that one of them had a rifle. It was not immediately clear whether Dulmatin , a member of the Jemaah Islamiah group, one of Indonesia"s most wanted men, whom authorities allege played a role in the a role in the 2002 bombing in Bali , was among those killed.  Ansyaad Mbai, the chief of the security ministry, remarked to Agence France-Presse that '[i]f it"s true that it"s him, we will be very grateful that the most-wanted terrorist has been killed. It will be a big relief to us.' The BBC reports that DNA tests may be needed to determine whether or not Dulmatin was indeed among the dead men.
