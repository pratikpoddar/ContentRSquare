Caloundra lead Glasshouse by 153 runs at stumps on day two of the 2010 Sunshine Coast, Australia division one cricket grand final.'I think the nerves of a grand final gets to you too. It‚Äôs a totally different game. You try and put it in the back of your mind but it‚Äôs still there,‚Äù Glasshouse captain Brett Milini said.Caloundra were all out in their first inning for 193. In reply, Glasshouse could only manage 100.‚Ä?I thought it (bowling) was terrific. I thought 250 was a par score and I thought we were in with a big chance,‚Äù Milini said. 'If we were good enough, we should have got that pretty easy but we didn‚Äôt bat well today.'Caloundra rounded out day two at six out for fifty seven, leaving Glasshouse an outside chance of snatching the championship.‚Ä?We‚Äôve given ourselves another chance but if we bat like we did in the first innings, we‚Äôre already gone,‚Äù he said. ‚Ä?It should be a real good game, it‚Äôs interesting cricket.‚ÄùIn lower gradesResults for the second division, third B division, southern fourth division and fifth division traditional grand finals have not been accessible to Wikinews as of this report
