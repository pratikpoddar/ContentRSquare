 The 58th Annual Pacific Orchid Exposition took place Feb. 26â€“28 at the Fort Mason Center , San Francisco , California , sponsored by the San Francisco Orchid Society. This year"s theme for the expo"s displays was ' carnival ', though a number of winning entries were among the smaller and more sedate species of orchids, quite at odds with the typical ostentatious colors and displays of carnival. Alongside the orchid exposition were a gala party, silent auctions and market area.
