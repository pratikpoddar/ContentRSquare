A jawbone found in Aruba is not that of missing American Natalee Holloway , who was a recent high school -graduate at the time of her disappearance. Officials confirmed the news after Dutch scientists completed tests on the bone. The jawbone, which also had a wisdom tooth with it, was found by an American tourist close to the Phoenix Hotel. A second bone had also been found by another tourist earlier this month.The bone was sent to the Netherlands Forensic Institute where scientists completed tests. They compared the bone to dental records given to them by Natalee"s father, from which they confirmed the the bone was not that of Natalee, although it was human. It was said to be unlikely that the bone was Holloway"s as there is no physical evidence that she was murdered.Taco Stein , the Aruban Solicitor General , released a statement after the announcement was made. He commented on the speed of the identification; he said that they had quickly ruled out Holloway because her records had shown that she had her wisdom teeth previously removed.Tim Miller, the Director of the Texas EquuSearch , released a statement after talking to Natalee"s father. He said â€œDave [Natalee"s father] has been in contact with Aruban authorities and spoke with FBI this morning, the agent working the case. Dave believes it is Natalee.â€?An attorney for Natalee"s mother, Beth Twitty, released a statement saying 'Beth accepts the forensic conclusions, is emotionally exhausted from the inexplicably long wait, and deeply disappointed in the time and manner in which she learned of the results.' He commented on the Aruban authorities saying that 'Apparently Aruban prosecutors were more sensitive to media concerns than the painful vigil of a mother.'Natalee Holloway disappeared on the island in 2005 while on a school trip. She was last seen leaving a nightclub with three men, one of which was later identified as Joran van der Sloot . Van der Sloot was detained twice by police but has never been charged with Holloway"s disappearance. He is currently in Peru facing a different murder charge. Aruban authorities have said that they are checking neighboring islands to find a match for other missing persons.
